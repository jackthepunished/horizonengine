# Contributing to HorizonEngine

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to HorizonEngine!  
HorizonEngine is an experimental 3D game engine written in Rust, focused on
learning-oriented but production-grade engine architecture.

We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug fixes, features, refactors,
documentation improvements, and discussions.

##  Project Goals

HorizonEngine aims to:
- Explore modern game engine architecture
- Emphasize correctness, clarity, and performance
- Stay minimal, readable, and modular
- Avoid premature abstractions

This is **not** a toy project, but also **not** a full commercial engine.
Changes should align with learning value and long-term maintainability.
